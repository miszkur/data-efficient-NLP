They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)","I paid my first fee at the start of my 210-mile return trip to Monterey. I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.

Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.","Nissan NCTC2015-05-10Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps in their current design should have separate listings for L3s, so status (as in repair) and alarms (as in all stations that are in use and station has become available) make sense for real human users of electric vehicles.

841,"	As a summer intern at Holman Cadillac in Mount Laurel, I've been looking for ways to improve our communication with clients about what it's like to own an EV, and to ease some of the common concerns potential buyers have. I tried to gain insight by taking the Cadillac ELR to all of the public charging stations in the local South Jersey area and judging the ease of use and abundance of stations over specific areas. This station had an affordable $5 nominal fee and was housed near the Chapel Ave side main entrance to the complex. Equipped with two spaces and two chargers, this station is within walking distance to the Cherry Hill Mall, Loews Movie Theater, and several other restaurants and attractions. www.holmancadillac.com ","As a summer intern at Holman Cadillac in Mount Laurel, I was looking for ways to improve our communication with customers about what it's like to own an electric vehicle, and to allay some of the general concerns of potential buyers.

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)","I paid my first fee at the start of my 210-mile return trip to Monterey. I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.

He said this week LADWP has internal meetings to start having a dedicated person to manage maintenance for LADWP chargers, which would hopefully include a maintenance contact with Nissan so issues will be fixed more promptly.

If you do use this number, please be courteous and know that he is NOT the one fixing these issues, but he is helping coordinate maintenance and ultimately a maintenance contract with Nissan. He was very informative and I thanked him for the info!

Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.","Nissan NCTC2015-05-10Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps in their current design should have separate listings for L3s, so status (as in repair) and alarms (as in all stations that are in use and station has become available) make sense for real human users of electric vehicles.

For some odd reason, the Chargepoint app was showing that one of the two chargers was in use, when in fact NEITHER was in use. After I plugged in, it showed that BOTH were in use. Must be a bug.

The grocery store has a deli with hot food and sushi, and it's a grocery store, so you can get pretty much anything you want (cold drinks, coffee, etc.)

The deli area has some tables and chairs to sit and eat at, and also has free WiFi. There was a picnic table and shade umbrella outside as well.

If you get some food ""to go"", do yourself a favor and walk one country block west to Tyranea Park. It's a little wooded park with plenty of picnic tables and access to Rock Lake. I sat down by the lake and ate lunch. When I got back to my electric motorcycle, it was fully charged.

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.  The security guard is very nice guy who ""would not really notice"" a non-employ in the L2 charge lot (20+ chargers/spots mostly empty!   There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)","I paid my first fee at the start of my 210-mile return trip to Monterey. I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.

Thank you and have fun with your new car.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The 100k array is laterally pumping electrons into your battery during the day.  
I paid for my first charge on the beginning  of my 210 mile return trip to Monterey.  I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.  They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power. (about $2)  I was not required to join ""Greenlots"" but the guy on the phone was so nice I probably will since they seem about the same as Chargepoint and offer reasonable rates.

There is also a L2 port at the east side of visitor lot but it is frequently used by EV employs for prime parking.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)","I paid my first fee at the start of my 210-mile return trip to Monterey. I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.

7566,"Joel,  If you haven't been watching the EV Fast Charger prices, I can understand your reaction to our price.  Here is a sample of our Fast Charging competition.  The Blink network charges $0.65/kWh ($0.59 for members) and eVgo, charges $4.95 + $0.20/minute or &gt;$10 for a 30 minute charge.  The average fast charge at our site is about 10 kWh, which would be $8.90 for a charge of about 30 minutes.  Both Blink and eVgo networks were built on government grants with equipment not meant for a coastal environment.  

As for usage, we did not see a dramatic increase in usage when technical problems caused us to offer fast charging for free this summer and we have not seen a dramatic decrease in usage now that we have resumed charging for the power.

We are constrained by our costs.  Commercial power costs $0.24/kWh and we risk a $3.00/kWh demand charge if the fast charger causes us to exceed peak demand.  We also have network, insurance, security, rent and the installation costs.  The fast charger costs 6-7 times what the 220v charger costs, which means a higher price to use.
  
So, we're not going to offer fast charging at the same price as 220v charging, instead we offer drivers a choice.  You can balance the extra hour charging time versus the extra $5.00 for 10kWh.  The important thing is that an area of California that was not conveniently accessible to EVs now is.  We have customers using both chargers and we welcome everyone.

Sincerely,
Richard Sachen

Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.","Nissan NCTC2015-05-10Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps in their current design should have separate listings for L3s, so status (as in repair) and alarms (as in all stations that are in use and station has become available) make sense for real human users of electric vehicles.
