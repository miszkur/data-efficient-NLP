They just charge 20 cents/kwh and still make 100% profit on the power.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Other nearby Nissan Leaf dealer charge info below:

I recommend  Davis Nissan for a better sales/customer service experience.   They not only offer free Chademo but want to come out and chat EV and help you plug in.

Both Roseville Future and Elk Grove nissan must be some of the worst dealers in California.  I recommend a free L2 charge on these facilities and spreading the word about Davis Nissan.


Roseville Future and Elk Grove  Nissan dealer does not seem to want to promote EVs.  They have sold rights of the ChAdeMo fast charge over to  EVgo.  It will cost you about 10$ per 50% charge.  What a bummer for leaf buyers who bought from these dealers.  They also offer man ""plans"" like AT&T at even more cost such as the $15/month plan with $29 cancelation fee;-(((

Elk Grove :  There are also only 4 spaces for 5 charges.  I had to block the ChadeMO so I could do a free L2 charge.

The sales manger was not really interested in any of my comments for creating and supporting his leaf customers.  They did have all these ""customer appreciation event"" signs in the lobby.  I guess it must be more about training for manager;-)","I paid my first fee at the start of my 210-mile return trip to Monterey. I used the new SMUD (Sacramento) Fast SAE and Chademo.

Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.","Nissan NCTC2015-05-10Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps in their current design should have separate listings for L3s, so status (as in repair) and alarms (as in all stations that are in use and station has become available) make sense for real human users of electric vehicles.
