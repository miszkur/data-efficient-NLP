There were no signs or warnings about the time limit within which you can charge your car or the possibility of loading it. So we filed a complaint with the Department of Consumer Affairs of NYC for unlawful loading, as there was no sign of it. Also, I found out from the DCA that only towing companies are allowed to boot, the removal of the trunk should be up to $25, in cash or by credit, and the trunk should be removed within 30 minutes of the time you paid the fine. They charged us $75 and only demanded cash. We're arguing this issue now and we'll let you know how it works.

The charging is, in my opinion, more for guests, although the owner also said that a non-guest who drives through is welcome to use the charging at this point (this inscription dates from 2015-02-08).I suggest that other electric drivers make an effort to be polite and express gratitude for using the charging, as there are very few public stations in this area.The owner may sometime install J1772 or similar, but at this point it is only 120 volts and NEMA 14-50.

Because 4 (really 3 stations) and the 9 plug-in vehicles parked there cannot be charged in a working day today. Get the county to install MORE! Technically, the PHEVs and hybrids shouldn't hit the chargers first, because they have gas and a safety device to drive. Electric vehicles don't (but Tesla's have their own own own charging network that they don't let others play on). These 4 units are taxable and are funded by the counties so they are PUBLIC, no matter what.

Average fast charging at our site is about 10 kWh, which would be $8.90 for a charge of about 30 minutes. Both Blink and eVgo networks have been built on government subsidies with equipment not intended for a coastal environment. In terms of consumption, we haven't seen a dramatic increase in consumption when technical problems prompted us to offer fast charging for free this summer, and we haven't seen a dramatic drop in consumption now that we've resumed charging for electricity. We're constrained by our costs. Commercial electricity costs $0.24 / kWh, and we risk a $3.00 charge when the fast charger causes us to peak demand.",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
